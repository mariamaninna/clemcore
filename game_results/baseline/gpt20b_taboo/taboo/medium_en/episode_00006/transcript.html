        <p>We need to produce a single guess. The clue: &quot;The original source that supplies elements for a finished product.&quot; Likely answer: &quot;raw material&quot;. But we need a single word. Could be &quot;raw&quot;. But maybe &quot;source&quot;. But &quot;source&quot; is too generic. &quot;Raw material&quot; is two words. But maybe the answer is &quot;raw&quot;. But that seems off. Could be &quot;input&quot;. But &quot;input&quot; is generic. The phrase &quot;original source&quot; suggests &quot;origin&quot;. But &quot;origin&quot; supplies elements? Not really. &quot;Raw material&quot; is the best. But we need a single word. Could be &quot;raw&quot;. But &quot;raw&quot; is not a source. But maybe the answer is &quot;raw&quot;. But I&#x27;m not convinced.<br/><br/>Maybe the answer is &quot;raw&quot;. But let&#x27;s think: In manufacturing, the original source that supplies elements is &quot;raw material&quot;. The clue might be hinting at &quot;raw&quot;. But the game might accept &quot;raw&quot;. But I&#x27;m not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, the answer could be &quot;source&quot;. But that seems too generic. But maybe the answer is &quot;source&quot;. But the clue says &quot;original source that supplies elements for a finished product.&quot; That is basically &quot;source&quot;. But maybe the answer is &quot;source&quot;.<br/><br/>But the game might want &quot;raw material&quot;. But we can guess &quot;raw material&quot;. But we need a single word. But maybe the answer is &quot;raw&quot;. But I&#x27;m not convinced.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the answer is &quot;raw&quot;.
