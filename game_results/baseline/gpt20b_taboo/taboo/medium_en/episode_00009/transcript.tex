                \texttt{I’ve spent a lifetime chasing shadows—first on the streets of a city that never slept, then in the quiet of my study, where the only lights are the flicker of a desk lamp and the glow of a screen. Now, as a retired detective turned crime novelist, I’ve traded trench coats for tweed jackets and crime scenes for coffee stains. Yet the one mystery that still keeps me on my toes is the one that lives in the corner of my living room: Whiskers, the cat who loves to chase laser pointers.} \\
\\ 
\texttt{Whiskers is a sleek, silver‑furred enigma, a creature of habit and impulse. He sits, tail flicking, as I flick the red dot across the floor. He darts, leaps, and pounces with the same ferocity I once reserved for a suspect in a cold case. The laser is a moving target, a crime scene that never repeats itself. Each chase is a new puzzle: Where will the dot go next? What will the cat do? The answers are always the same—he will chase, he will pounce, and I will watch, noting the rhythm of his movements like a detective notes the cadence of a suspect’s confession.} \\
\\ 
\texttt{In my novels, I write about the human tendency to chase elusive truths. Whiskers reminds me that sometimes the chase is the point. The laser pointer is a simple device, but it turns my quiet apartment into a crime scene, my cat into a suspect, and me into a witness. And in that moment, I realize that the greatest mysteries are not solved by evidence or interrogation, but by the simple, relentless pursuit of a red dot.} \\
